-- the world showing through over a route. BattlePics puts the paper back.
--

-- background cannot reach. Started at the image border that finds nothing at
-- all -- a Gen 1 figure is an open drawing, and its belly walks out between
-- two legs and off the bottom of the frame -- so every mon was a stencil.
--
-- So the flood starts at the edges of the ARTWORK'S OWN BOX, and at three of
-- them: left, right and top. The bottom is closed, because it is not a side
-- the background is behind -- it is where the drawing was CUT. A pic is
-- bottom-aligned in its slot with the margin all at the top, so a mon's lowest
-- row is the last row it was given. Seed that cut and the background pours up
-- inside the figure, which was the channel of world showing through the middle
-- of a Clefairy.
--
-- Both halves are driven here, because getting one right at the other's
-- expense is exactly what went wrong twice: an earlier rule that filled
-- anything with ink to its left, right and above closed the channel and then
-- filled the notch between a Rattata's ears and the gap between its body and
